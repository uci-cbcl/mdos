MDOS: a method for Motif Discovery using Orthologous Sequences

MDOC is a comparative genomics method for regulatory motif discovery. Different from previous
methods, it does not require or use sequence alignments. It is particularly suitable for 
discovering motifs in highly diverged genomes, or genomes with sequence alignments difficult 
to obtain or poor in quality.
