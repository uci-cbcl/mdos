MDOS: a method for Motif Discovery using Orthologous Sequences

MDOS is a comparative genomics method for regulatory motif discovery. Different from previous
methods, it does not require or use sequence alignments. It is particularly suitable for 
discovering motifs in highly diverged genomes, or genomes with sequence alignments difficult 
to obtain or poor in quality.


To run the program: use the following command line:

java -jar mdos.jar input_seq_file kmer_size 

#input_seq_file: is the filename of input sequences.  The format of the file should start with ">id", 
                 followed by two lines of sequences representing sequences from each of the two genomes 
		 being compared. For an example: see test.seq file
#kmer_size:      the size of k-mer 


Note that you will need java version 1.5 or above to run the code. 
The java code uses two external packages: trove-2.0.3.jar and commons-math-1.1.jar, which need to be placed 
in the same directory as the mdos.jar file. 


For a test run,
1. Download the 1Kb upstream sequences of orthologous genes between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus from:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~xhx/project/mdos/data/CER_BAY_U.fa

2. Run: java -jar mdos.jar CER_BAY_U.fa 7
This will calculate the conservation z-scores of all 7-mers and expand those with z-scores>=2 to include degenerate codes.
